# Matcha

 This project is about creating a dating website.

## HOW TO USE

### Node Setup

1. Run `cd` until you are in the same folder as `package.json`
2. Run `npm install`, this will allow the npm to install all dependencies
 required to make the application run.
NB: Ensure that __port 4500__ is free and that no service is currently using it, a new port can
be defined in `api/server.js`

----------**!Shortcut - Notice**

`npm run build`

----------

1. Run `node start.js` at least once! This will create the database
2. Run npm start. If this has run successfully, the console will print:

 > Matcha has started running/listening on port 5000!

#### SEEDED MySQL Database

## MYSQL SETUP AND TEST

1. Run `sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client`
2. Run `sudo -u root -p` enter your sudo password if it requests the sudo password
 or leave it blank if it is the MySql password, assuming you have not previously
 entered a MySql password.
3. With the `mysql>` prompt enter the following
 `ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' identified WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';`

   - Note that this changes the password to password so you may alter the above statement
  in that regard.

4. Run `service mysql restart` or `service mysql stop` followed by `service mysql start`

   - Install MySQL Workbench to use a GUI

5. Test the success of your work by opening a terminal and running `node start.js`

   - if it is successful
  
 > MySQL Database has Connected
 will be printed in the console.

- if unsuccessful the console will return an error.

__FINALLY RUN__ `node server.js`
